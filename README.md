### How to work with this repo

Run <code>git clone \<PATH>\</code> to clone the repo.

To switch to the dev branch run <code>git checkout dev</code>.

To merge dev into master when on dev run <code>git checkout master</code> then <code>git pull origin master</code> and <code>git merge dev</code>. Lastly run all the cells again (to ensure all is up to date) and push <code>git push</code>

<b>Always</b> push code to the dev branch <b>without</b> the output from each cell. This will be our working branch. When something runs as intended, it can be merged into master as shown above **with** output (this is to avoid merge conflicts which are a headache in .ipynb projects).
