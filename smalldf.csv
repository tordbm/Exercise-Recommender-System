3,single-arm bent-over rear delt fly,"The single-arm bent-over rear delt fly is a popular upper-body exercise that targets the muscles on the back of the shoulder joint, specifically the rear head of the deltoid. Since pressing movements build the front and (to a lesser degree) side deltoid heads, this move is often done to promote balanced shoulder development. It is usually performed for high reps, such as 10-15 reps per set or more, as part of a shoulder or upper-body workout.",Strength,Abdominals,Other,Intermediate,8.3,12

The main difference between this exercise and the standard bench press is that the hands are placed farther apart on the bar. Many lifters find they can handle more weight going wide than with narrower grips, although it's also worth noting that plenty of banged-up lifters have said benching with a wide grip may also have contributed to their shoulder injuries and pain. The wide-grip bench is often used as a chest-building movement in chest or upper-body workouts, or as an accessory movement for the traditional bench press.",Strength,Chest,Barbell,Beginner,8.9,5
25,incline bench press,"The incline bench press is a popular barbell exercise targeting the chest muscles, particularly the upper pectoral muscles.
